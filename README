These are the sources for Isabelle 2019 for the Airplane Insider case study.
They use the generic framework of Modelchecking MC.thy.
On top of this is built
AirInsider.thy: formalisation of the Insider theory
Airplane.thy: the actual case study of the Insider attack on a passenger airplane

To run this download Isabelle from https://isabelle.in.tum.de 
(the tool is available for most platforms and has a very simple and
quick installation process well documented).
Then load the above three files into the Isabelle tool (using the file open
menu option). They will automatically be rechecked and proofs and output
can be rerun.

Additionally a more readable latex output can be generated from the Isabelle
sources (for details and for pregenerated pdf's of the entire theory and proofs
and a shorter outline, see the subdirectory latex contained here).

Other applications and extension of the Insider framework can be found here in 
the same github under IsabelleAT, for example (extension to Attack Trees and
application to IoT and Quantum Computing). Another application to Cocaine Auction
needs updating to isabelle 2019 but a version running with Isabelle 2016 can be 
found here:
Isabelle formalisation of cocaine auction protocol., 2016. Available from

This is a subfolder containing the generated latex output
for the Isabelle Insider framework based on Kripke structures
and modelchecking applied to the Airplane case study.

The folder document simply contains the pdf outputs:
- document.pdf (full version) and outline.pdf (defintions
  and theorems without proof)
- the correpsonding directories outline and document contian the
  corresponding resources

The whole output has been generated as follows (if one wishes to generate
an update):
- copy the files MC.thy AirInsider.thy and Airplan.thy into latex directory
- in a shell, for example bash-3.2 in my case, execute 
  bash-3.2$ isabelle build -D .
